# lemur.css: A Classless Stylesheet
<img src="./lemur.jpg" align="right" width="200" alt="A Nice Lemur"/>

lemur.css is a minimal classless stylesheet that makes your plain
HTML look slightly less plain. It is used in
[0ty](https://github.com/liammulh/0ty), a zero-config static site generator.

lemur.css is intended for my personal use with 0ty. If other people
want to use it, or want to contribute, great! It is minimal compared to
some popular classless CSS stylesheets. I will add to it if the need
arises.

## Usage

Link to lemur.css in the head of your HTML:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./lemur.css">
  <title>Title</title>
</head>
```

## The Name

Why lemur.css?

1. The CSS is nimble like a lemur.
2. As a little kid, one of my favorite TV shows was
   [Zoboomafoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoboomafoo).
